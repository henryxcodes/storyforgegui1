My sister Maya has always been the golden child. Perfect grades, perfect hair, perfect everything. But what she did at my engagement party crossed every line imaginable. She announced her own engagement - to my fianc√©'s best friend - using the exact same ring style I'd been showing everyone for months. The same ring that David had supposedly "secretly" picked out just for me. That's when I realized this wasn't just sibling rivalry anymore. This was war. And Maya had no idea what she'd just started.
